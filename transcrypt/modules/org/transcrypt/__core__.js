/* Nested module-object creator, part of the nesting may already exist and have attributes

A Transcrypt applicaton consists of a main module and additional modules.
Transcrypt modules constitute a unique, unambiguous tree by their dotted names, no matter which of the alternative module root paths they come from.
The main module is represented by a main function with the name of the application.
The locals of this function constitute the outer namespace of the Transcrypt application.
References to all local variables of this function are also assigned to attributes of local variable __all__, using the variable names as an attribute names.
The main function returns this local variable __all__ (that inside the function is also known by the name __world__)
Normally this function result is assigned to window.<application name>.
The function may than be exitted (unless its main line starts an ongoing activity), but the application namespace stays alive by the reference that window has to it.
In case of the ongoing activity including the script is enough to start it, in other cases it has to be started explicitly by calling window.<application name>.<entrypoint function>.
There may be multiple such entrypoint functions.

Additional modules are represented by objects rather than functions, nested into __world__ (so into __all__ of the main function).
This nesting can be directly or indirectly, according to the dotted paths of the additional modules.
One of the methods of the module object is the __init__ function, that's executed once at module initialisation time.

The additional modules also have an __all__ variable, an attribute rather than a local variable.
However this __all__ object is passed to the __init__ function, so becomes a local variable there.
Variables in additional modules first become locals to the __init__ function but references to all of them are assigned to __all__ under their same names.
This resembles the cause of affairs in the main function.
However __world__ only referes to the __all__ of the main module, not of any additional modules.
Importing a module boils down to adding all members of its __all__ to the local namespace, directly or via dotted access, depending on the way of import.

In each local namespace of the module function (main function for main module, __init__ for additional modules) there's a variable __name__ holding the name of the module.
Classes are created inside the static scope of a particular module, and at that (class creation) time their variable __module__ gets assigned a reference to __name__.
This assignement is generated explicitly by the compiler, as the class creation function __new__ of the metaclass isn't in the static scope containing __name__.

In case of
    import a
    import a.b
a will have been created at the moment that a.b is imported,
so all a.b. is allowed to do is an extra attribute in a, namely a reference to b,
not recreate a, since that would destroy attributes previously present in a

In case of
    import a.b
    import a
a will have to be created at the moment that a.b is imported

In general in a chain
    import a.b.c.d.e
a, a.b, a.b.c and a.b.c.d have to exist before e is created, since a.b.c.d should hold a reference to e.
Since this applies recursively, if e.g. c is already created, we can be sure a and a.b. will also be already created.

So to be able to create e, we'll have to walk the chain a.b.c.d, starting with a.
As soon as we encounter a module in the chain that isn't already there, we'll have to create the remainder (tail) of the chain.

e.g.
    import a.b.c.d.e
    import a.b.c

will generate
    var modules = {};
    __nest__ (a, 'b.c.d.e', __init__ (__world__.a.b.c.d.e));
    __nest__ (a, 'b.c', __init__ (__world__.a.b.c));
    
The task of the __nest__ function is to start at the head object and then walk to the chain of objects behind it (tail),
creating the ones that do not exist already, and insert the necessary module reference attributes into them.
