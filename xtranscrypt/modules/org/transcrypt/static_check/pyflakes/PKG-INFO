Description: ========
        Pyflakes
        ========
        
        A simple program which checks Python source files for errors.
        
        Pyflakes analyzes programs and detects various errors.  It works by
        parsing the source file, not importing it, so it is safe to use on
        modules with side effects.  It's also much faster.
        
        It is `available on PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes>`_
        and it supports all active versions of Python from 2.5 to 3.5.
        
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It can be installed with::
        
          $ pip install --upgrade pyflakes
        
        
        Useful tips:
        
        * Be sure to install it for a version of Python which is compatible
          with your codebase: for Python 2, ``pip2 install pyflakes`` and for
          Python3, ``pip3 install pyflakes``.
        
        * You can also invoke Pyflakes with ``python3 -m pyflakes .`` or
          ``python2 -m pyflakes .`` if you have it installed for both versions.
        
        * If you require more options and more flexibility, you could give a
          look to Flake8_ too.
          
        
        Design Principles
        -----------------
        Pyflakes makes a simple promise: it will never complain about style,
        and it will try very, very hard to never emit false positives.
        
        Pyflakes is also faster than Pylint_
        or Pychecker_. This is
        largely because Pyflakes only examines the syntax tree of each file
        individually. As a consequence, Pyflakes is more limited in the
        types of things it can check.
        
        If you like Pyflakes but also want styleistic checks, you want
        flake8_, which combines
        Pyflakes with style checks against
        `PEP 8`_ and adds
        per-project configuration ability.
